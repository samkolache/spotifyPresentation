                                <p>As of November 2020, DocuSign CLM eForms cannot be made public. If your 
                                    account has at least one active public eForm, you can still use this 
                                    functionality without interruption. eForms can still 
                                    contain CSS and attributes but, from November 2020 onward, use of 
                                    JavaScript in new forms is not supported.

                                <p>We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to inform you of an 
                                    important update regarding the login criteria for DocuSign CLM.
                                </p>
                                <p>As of the latest update, DocuSign CLM has redefined the login name 
                                    criteria to enhance security measures. Going forward, your login name 
                                    must begin with either an alpha or numeric character only. 
                                    Special characters such as ! ? & , etc., will no longer be accepted as 
                                    the first character of your login name.
                                </p>
                                <p>In order to ensure that your account remains accessible, we kindly 
                                    request that you update your login criteria as soon as possible. 
                                    This can be done by logging into your DocuSign CLM account, 
                                    accessing your account settings, and selecting a new login name that 
                                    complies with the new criteria.

                                <p>2. Public eForms: As of November 2020, DocuSign CLM eForms cannot be

                <div class="box-8 content-center">
                    <p>Dear [Stakeholder Name],</p>
                    <p>I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on your suggestion to auto-publish SSNs with full names and grades on our secure website. 
                        As a team, we have discussed this proposal and have some concerns about the potential risks associated with this approach.
                        We believe that student privacy must be protected at all times, and publishing SSNs alongside student names and grades could compromise this privacy. 
                        Additionally, there may be legal or regulatory implications to consider, depending on where our school or university is located. Finally, we want to 
                        ensure that our students are comfortable with the way their information is being shared, and we are concerned that some may not be comfortable having 
                        their SSN published online.
                    </p>
                    <p>As an alternative, we suggest using the Student ID as a unique identifier to connect grades with each student. The Student ID can be used as a primary 
                        key and is a unique identifier that does not compromise student privacy. If stakeholders are concerned about the security of the Student ID, we can 
                        suggest hashing or encrypting the ID to ensure that it remains secure.
                    </p>
                    <p>We cannot stress enough the importance of protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) at all times. This is a classified data level 1 and must be 
                        safeguarded against any unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. If this information is compromised, it can result in significant legal trouble, 
                        reputation damage, and identity theft.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, we want to remind stakeholders of the privacy rights that students have. Any release of student information must be done with the student's 
                        permission, and their privacy rights must be respected at all times.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thank you for your understanding and your commitment to our students' well-being.</p>
